### Hi there, I'm Gus :octocat:<br>
I'm a multiskilled Web Developer with strong Graphic Design experience currently based in Bristol :uk:. 
<br />
I deployed my first web pages in 2004 on GeoCities and since then I didn't stop.
<br /><br />
As well as being a company collaborator, I have been working as a freelancer (graphic designer/web developer) since 2008 which allowed me to build up my background by producing distinct projects.
<br /><br />
I love technology and follow closely the latest trends on the web development scene, where I am looking for challenging opportunities to push myself.
Striving for elegance, scalability, and maintainability, in architecture, code, and visuals.
